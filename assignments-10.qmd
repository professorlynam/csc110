# Programming Problem 19

**Due date: `r assignments %>% filter(assessment == "Module 10 Programming Problems") %>% pull(formatted_date)` at 7pm**

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `zip_lists`
2.  It takes three arguments: `list_1`, `list_2`, `list_3` -- all of the same length
3.  It iterates over all three lists (remember, they have the same length, so you can use the same index for all of them) appending to a new list of tuples of three elements
4.  It returns the list of tuples

Test cases:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print( zip_lists([1, 2], ["a", "b"], [1.0, 2.0]) ) # [(1, "a", 1.0), (2, "b", 2.0)]
print( zip_lists([], [], []) ) # []
```

Name the program `create_tuples.py`. Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.

# Programming Problem 20

**Due date: `r assignments %>% filter(assessment == "Module 10 Programming Problems") %>% pull(formatted_date)` at 7pm**

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `all_mappings`
2.  It takes a single `dictionary` as an argument, which maps strings to lists of integers
3.  It returns a list of 2-value tuples, where the first value of the tuples is a key from D, and the second value is an element from its associated list value

Test cases:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print( all_mappings({"a": [7, 3, 1]}) ) # [("a", 7), ("a", 3), ("a", 1)]
print( all_mappings({"a": [8], "b": [2]}) ) # [("a", 8), ("b", 2)]
print( all_mappings({"a": [], "b": [2]}) ) # [("b", 2)]
print( all_mappings({}) ) # []
```

Name the program `mappings.py`. Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
