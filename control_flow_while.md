# Control Flow (while) {#control-flow}

The `while` statement allows you to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a condition is true. A `while` statement is an example of what is called a *looping* statement. A `while` statement can have an optional `else` clause.

Example:

``` python
def guessing_game(n):
  running = True
  while running:
      guess = int(input('Enter an integer : '))
  
      if guess == number:
          print('Congratulations, you guessed it.')
          # this causes the while loop to stop
          running = False
      elif guess < number:
          print('No, it is a little higher than that.')
      else:
          print('No, it is a little lower than that.')
  else:
      print('The while loop is over.')
      # Do anything else you want to do here

def main():
  number = 23
  guessing_game(number)
  print('Done')
  
main()
```

Output:

```{=html}
<pre><code>
Enter an integer : 50
No, it is a little lower than that.
Enter an integer : 22
No, it is a little higher than that.
Enter an integer : 23
Congratulations, you guessed it.
The while loop is over.
Done
</code></pre>
```
**How It Works**

In this program, we are still playing the guessing game, but the advantage is that the user is allowed to keep guessing until he guesses correctly - there is no need to repeatedly run the program for each guess, as we have done in the previous section. This aptly demonstrates the use of the `while` statement.

We move the `input` and `if` statements to inside the `while` loop and set the variable `running` to `True` before the while loop. First, we check if the variable `running` is `True` and then proceed to execute the corresponding *while-block*. After this block is executed, the condition is again checked which in this case is the `running` variable. If it is true, we execute the while-block again, else we continue to execute the optional else-block and then continue to the next statement.

The `else` block is executed when the `while` loop condition becomes `False` - this may even be the first time that the condition is checked. If there is an `else` clause for a `while` loop, it is always executed unless you break out of the loop with a `break` statement.

The `True` and `False` are called Boolean types and you can consider them to be equivalent to the value `1` and `0` respectively.

## Summary

We have seen how to use the `while` statement. This is commonly used parts of Python and hence, becoming comfortable with them is essential.
