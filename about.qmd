# Readings

The readings for this course are a modified version of ["A Byte of Python"](https://python.swaroopch.com/)-- a free book on programming using the Python language. This texbook is good for beginners as well as for experts, and more importantly, is fun to program with. The book originally aims to help you learn this wonderful language and show how to get things done quickly and painlessly.
