The Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UGTAs or TAs) in this class are here to help. You are also welcome to send an email.

The best way to talk with a particular TA is via office hours, so check the schedule (scroll down this page).

# Senior TAs

Senior UGTAs in the Department of Computer Science are experienced UGTAs (with at least 2 semesters of CS UGTA experience), who take on a leadership role. They will assist with UGTA hiring, work closely with the course coordinator on various tasks, lead UGTA training, and mentor new UGTAs. If you are interested in becoming a TA in the future, reach out to the senior TAs.

# TAs

Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UGTAs) in the Department of Computer Science assist instructors in delivering undergraduate computer science courses. CS introductory courses utilize active learning and collaborative learning spaces to provide a collaborative and supportive environment for students learning programming skills. All teaching assistants have taken and excelled in the courses they support and are familiar with the material to mentor new students as they learn.
