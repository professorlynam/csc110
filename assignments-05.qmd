Programming Problems should be submitted to [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/568720).

# Programming Problem 9

**Due date: `r assignments %>% filter(assessment == "Module 5 Programming Problems") %>% pull(formatted_date)`  at 7pm**

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `count_vowels`
2.  It takes one string as argument
3.  It counts how many vowels there are in the string using a `while` loop
4.  It returns an integer representing the number of vowels (`a`, `e` `i`, `o`, `u` -- both lowercase and uppercase) found in the argument
5.  You can (and should) use the operator `in`
6.  You are not allowed to use built-in count methods or functions

Name the program `vowels.py`. Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test cases.

Test cases for development:

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
def main():
  print( count_vowels("") ) # 0
  print( count_vowels("aaa") ) # 3
  print( count_vowels("AEIOU") ) # 5
  print( count_vowels("cysts") ) # 0
  
main()
```


# Programming Problem 10

**Due date: `r assignments %>% filter(number == 8) %>% pull(formatted_date)` at 7pm**

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `reverse_string`
2.  It takes one string as argument
3.  Using a `while` loop, it builds a new string that is the reverse of the original string
4.  It returns the reversed string

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `remove_spaces`
2.  It takes one string as argument
3.  Using a `while` loop to create a string with no spaces
4.  Return the news string with no spaces

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `is_palindrome`
2.  It takes one string as argument
3.  It checks whether the string is a palindrome. A Palindrome reads the same backward and forward. For example: madam, and nurses run
4.  It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise
5.  Use your `remove_spaces` function to remove spaces from the argument before you check if the string is a palindrome
6.  Use your `reverse_string` function to reverse the string and then compare the result to the original string

Name the program `palindrome.py`. Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test cases.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
def main():
  print( reverse_string("aeiou") ) # uoiea
  print( remove_spaces("ae io ua") ) # aeioua
  
  print( is_palindrome("noon") ) # True
  print( is_palindrome("deified") ) # True
  print( is_palindrome("go deliver a dare vile dog") ) # True
  
main()
```
