title: "Common Gradescope Errors"
---

You might find that your code runs in your computer but it you get errors on Gradescope. Often the problem is not Gradescope, but your code.

Here's some of these common problems and how to solve them:

# Mismatch in file name

```{html}
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'misspeled file name'
```

Check the instructions and the error message for the right file name spelling. Remember that capitalization matters: `Hello.py` is different from `hello.py`

# Mismatch in function name

```{html}
Test Failed: name 'farenheit' is not defined
```

Check the instructions for the correct function name. In the example above, the autograder is trying to call `fahrenheit()` and the function was written without the `h` after `a`.

# Conversion function error

```{html}
Test Failed: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3.5'
```

The autograder is providing the string "3.5" as an argument, and your code is trying to convert "3.5" to an integer using `int()`. You should convert the argument to a float instead.

# EOF error

```{html}
EOF Error: EOF when reading a line
```

You are calling `input()` or a function that calls `input()` -- remove all function calls outside functions. For example, if you are calling `main()`, delete it.

# Infinite loop

```{html}
Your submission timed out. It took longer than 600 seconds to run.
```

Your code has an infinite loop, so the autograder ran until it timed out. Make sure you are updating your index **inside** your while loop so that you eventually get out of that while loop.
