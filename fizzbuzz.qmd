The FizzBuzz Problem is a common coding problem given during interviews where candidates are asked to write a solution to the problem. The problem states the following:

1.  An integer divisible by 3 should be labeled "Fizz"
2.  An integer divisible by 5 should be labeled "Buzz"
3.  An integer divisible by both 3 and 5 should be labeled "FizzBuzz"

You should try to solve this on your own, before watching my solution:
