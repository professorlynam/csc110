# CSC 110 -- Sorting

## Announcements

* Final exams (BRING PHOTO ID):
* Study guide on the practice problems page

## Sorting

-   A number of reasons to want sorted data
    -   For doing binary search!
    -   Finding a median value
    -   Finding the min and max
    -   Others?

## Sorting

-   lists have built-in functionality to rearrange the elements to be in sorted order
    -   **list_var.sort()**
    -   **sorted(list_var)**
-   But, someone at some point had to come up with an **algorithm** for this!
-   How does sorting work, behind the scenes?

## What is a sorted list?

-   A **sorting algorithm** is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order
-   However, there are different types of "ordering"
    -   Ascending numeric order (numbers)
    -   Descending numeric order (numbers)
    -   Lexicographic (strings)
    -   Others...
-   We will mostly stick with Ascending numeric for the examples in this lecture

## What is a sorted list?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
items = [5, 10, 20, 6, 7, 9, 43, 10, 12]
```

### Not sorted

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
items
```

### Sorted

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
items.sort()
items
```

## Discuss

Come up with a sorting algorithm

-   Discuss ideas for how to sort numbers

-   Depict your algorithm with drawings/diagrams or with pseudocode

-   Can't use the **.sort()** method

## In-place and out-of-place

-   **In-place sorting:** does not require a secondary data structure

-   **Out-of-place sorting:** may require a secondary data structure

## Selection sort

**Selection sort is a very simple sorting algorithm**

1.  Scan the list and find the smallest element

2.  Swap this element with the beginning element

3.  Continue these steps for the remaining list, not including the element just swapped

4.  Repeat

## Selection sort

-   Visualizing sorting algorithms with graphics can give one a better understanding

-   <https://visualgo.net/en/sorting>

## Write selection sort

1.  Function name is `selection_sort`
2.  It takes a list as argument
3.  It **mutates** the list argument, sorting it
4.  It iterates over the list, scanning the list to find the smallest element
5.  It swaps the smallest element found in each iteration with the beginning element (start with beginning element at zero indes, add one to beginning index with each iteration)

## Write selection sort -- solution

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
def find_min_index(items):
  min_index = None
  for i in range(len(items)):
    if min_index == None or items[min_index] > items[i]:
      min_index = i
  return min_index

def selection_sort(items):
  begin_index = 0
  while begin_index < len(items)-1:
    # get min of sublist, add begin_index to shift it
    min_index = find_min_index(items[begin_index:]) + begin_index
    items[begin_index], items[min_index] = items[min_index], items[begin_index]
    begin_index += 1
    
def main():
  test_list = [5, 10, 20, 6, 7, 9, 43, 10, 12]
  selection_sort(test_list)
  print(test_list)
  
main()
    
```

## How many total sweeps and swaps to sort this list?

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
numbers = [ 3, 1, 7, 2, 4 ]
```

## How many total sweeps and swaps to sort this list?

\[3, 1, 7, 2, 4\] sweep

\[1, 3, 7, 2, 4\] swap and sweep

\[1, 2, 7, 3, 4\] swap and sweep

\[1, 2, 3, 7, 4\] swap and sweep

\[1, 2, 3, 4, 7\] swap

4 sweeps

4 swaps (worst case scenario)

## How many total sweeps and swaps to sort this list?

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
numbers = [ 3, 1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5 ]
```

## How many total sweeps and swaps to sort this list?

\[ 3, 1, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5 \] sweep

\[ 1, 3, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5 \] swap and sweep

\[ 1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 8, 5 \] swap and sweep

\[ 1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 8, 5 \] swap and sweep

\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5 \] swap and sweep

\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7 \] swap and sweep

\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 \] swap

6 sweeps, 6 swaps

## Bubble sort

-   **Bubble Sort:** another sorting algorithm

    1.  Scan through each element in the list, comparing the current element with the next one

    2.  If the next one is smaller, swap the elements

    3.  Continue these iterations until the whole list is sorted

-   This causes the large elements to "bubble up" to the top

## Write bubble sort

1.  Function name is `bubble_sort`
2.  It takes a list as argument
3.  It **mutates** the list, sorting it
4.  It iterates over the list, comparing each element with the next one, if the next one is smaller, swap elements
5.  It continues these iterations until the whole list is sorted

## Write bubble sort -- solution 1

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
def bubble_sort(items):
  end = len(items)-1
  for i in range(len(items)-1):
    for j in range(end):
      if items[j] > items[j+1]:
        items[j], items[j+1] = items[j+1], items[j]
    end -=1
      
def main():
  test_list = [5, 10, 20, 6, 7, 9, 43, 10, 12]
  bubble_sort(test_list)
  print(test_list)
  
main()
```

    for i in range(end):
      if items[i] > items[i+1]:
        items[i], items[i+1] = items[i+1], items[i]
        is_sorted = False
    end -= 1
      
def main():
  test_list = [5, 10, 20, 6, 7, 9, 43, 10, 12]
